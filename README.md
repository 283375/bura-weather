- Customizable [Open-Meteo data sources](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#data-sources)

## Not planned
- Widgets
- Weather sources other than Open-Meteo
- Manual refresh
- Customizable refresh period

## Translate
Translations will be managed with [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/) if/when my libre hosting request is approved.

## Contribute
Open issues and/or pull requests targeting the `dev` branch.

## Donations
I do not accept donations at the moment. I tried to accept them on Prognoza, but as soon as I received the first donation, PayPal shut down my account.

## Why wasn't this an update to Prognoza?
- Bura is a complete rewrite that has nothing in common with Prognoza, except the dev :)
- Bura also looks completely different, and I figured some people might prefer Prognoza
- Prognoza's app ID is hr.dtakac.prognoza, but I don't own the domain
- Prognoza is licensed under the MIT License, which was a mistake
- Prognoza is written in KMM, which was also a mistake
